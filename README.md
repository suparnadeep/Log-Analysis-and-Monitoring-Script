# Log-Analysis-and-Monitoring-Script
Create a script that automates the analysis and monitoring of log files
Objective:
The primary aim is to develop a script that can handle two main tasks: monitoring log files in real-time for new entries and analyzing log entries to extract meaningful insights.

Requirements:
Scripting Language: The script should be written in either bash shell or Python.
Functionality:
Log File Monitoring: Continuously monitor a specified log file for new entries.
Log Analysis: Perform basic analysis on log entries, such as counting occurrences of specific keywords or patterns.
Error Handling and Logging: Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to provide feedback during script execution.
Tasks:
Log File Monitoring:
Develop a script that uses tools like tail or similar commands to track and display new log entries as they occur.
Implement a mechanism to stop the monitoring loop gracefully, such as handling signals like Ctrl+C.
Log Analysis:
Enhance the script to perform basic analysis on log entries, such as counting occurrences of specific keywords or patterns like error messages or HTTP status codes.
Generate summary reports based on the analysis, such as identifying the top error messages.
Deliverables:
Completed Script: Provide the finished script (log-monitor.sh for bash shell or log-monitor.py for Python) with all necessary functionalities implemented.
README.md File: Include a brief README file explaining how to use and test the script, along with any prerequisites or dependencies.
GitHub Repository: Host the solution on GitHub and share the repository link for evaluation.

Correctness and Completeness: Ensure that the script functions correctly and fulfills all requirements.
Code Structure and Clarity: Maintain clear and well-structured code with appropriate comments and variable naming conventions.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected situations gracefully.
Creativity and Additional Features: Consider implementing any additional features or enhancements beyond the basic requirements to improve the script's functionality.
The provided hint offers a starting point with a Python script demonstrating logging behavior for monitoring purposes. This can be extended and customized to meet the project requirements.

Overall, the project aims to create a versatile script that can efficiently monitor and analyze log files, providing valuable insights for system administrators or developers.
